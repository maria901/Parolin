Hi fellow programmer

dl1.bin file is the main exe file with a bin extension then you dont
need to compile it in order to use it 
this v9 a fixes the small bugs of v8 fixed that was causing
the compression to be larger than possible, data was not
being processed

if possible this v9 version will be the first to have a decoder, 
it will help avoid buggy encoders, and we plan to release a lot
of new versions
