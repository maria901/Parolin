Hi fellow programmer

dl1.bin file is the main exe file with a bin extension then you dont
need to compile it in order to use it 

each version have a number v6 is dl6.bin and so on

also ari.bin is the ari.exe and rle.bin is rle.exe the run lenght
compressor that may help the research at this moment, the external
arithmetic compressor that can be used after the v6 or above compression

it is recomended that ari is used after v6 or above compression it
earns a few kbs in size  at this moment
