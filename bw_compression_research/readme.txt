Hi fellow programmer

dl1.bin file is the main exe file with a bin extension then you dont
need to compile it in order to use it 

each version have a number v6 is dl6.bin and so on


latest current version available is v8 (dates from 12 jan 2022  16:50 PM)
but it will not compress prior versions

if when trying to uncompess a dl_compress based file it says that it needs 
a future version then you need the char == (value) and visit this page

for the patched value a binary will need to be downloaded, rename and used
to uncompress the file


version that says char == 53 will requires to download the binary file v9.c.bin, rename it to
v9.c.exe and use the uncompress the file (not available yet, yet to be released in a few hours)

version that says char == 54 will requires to download the binary file v10.bin, rename it to
v10.exe and use the uncompress the file (not available yet, yet to be released in a few days)


I hope you understood

and thanks for being part of our amazing research
