Hi fellow programmer

dl1.bin file is the main exe file with a bin extension then you dont
need to compile it in order to use it 
this v8 fixed may have a bug because it is compressing too
much with only 8192 bytes dictionary

the mode it is it is outperforming zlib by a large margin

at 3:30 AM I will have an answer if it is buggy or not, but
you also can examinate the sources for problems
